Automatically create directories that don't exist yet when writing a file.

This allows you to do:

    vim ~/a/dir/tree/that/doesnt/exist/new-file.txt

and then just use `:w` (or `ZZ`, or `:up`, etc.) to create the directory tree.

This is basically the same as the [`auto_mkdir`](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3352)
plugin, although it was developed independently. This version has the option to
confirm directory creation and includes a bugfix for unicode directory names.

See `:help auto_mkdir2` for the full documentation.
