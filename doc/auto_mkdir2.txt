auto_mkdir2.vim: Automatically create directories

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                     *auto_mkdir2*

Automatically create directories that don't exist yet when writing a file.

This allows you to do:
>
  vim ~/a/dir/tree/that/doesnt/exist/new-file.txt
<
and then just use |:w| (or |ZZ|, or |:up|, etc.) to create the directory tree.

This is basically the same as the "auto_mkdir" plugin, although it was
developed independently. This version has the option to confirm directory
creation and includes a bugfix for unicode directory names.

==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                                  *auto_mkdir2_options*

*g:auto_mkdir2_confirm*                 (Boolean, default: 1)

        Ask for confirmation before automatically creating a directory.

*g:auto_mkdir2_allfiles*                (Boolean, default: 1)

        Setting |g:auto_mkdir2_allfiles| to 0 disables automatic directory
        creation. See |MkdirPC|.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                *auto_mkdir2_commands*

MkdirP [directory]                                                   *:MkdirP*

Like `mkdir -p` from the shell: it will create all intermediate directories
and will not show an error if the [directory] already exists and is a
directory.

The [directory] is |expand()|-ed. The parameter is optional and [%:h:p] is
used if it is empty.

MkdirPC [directory]                                                  *:MkdirPC*

Functions identically to MkdirP except that appending a '!' will force the
creation, regardless of the value of |g:auto_mkdir2_confirm|.

This command is most useful if |g:auto_mkdir2_allfiles| == '0' as MkdirPC can
then be used in autocmds to turn on automatic directory creation for certain
files.

The following turns on automatic directory creation only for files with an
*.md extension: 

let |g:auto_mkdir2_allfiles| = 0
augroup auto_mkdir2
    autocmd!
	autocmd BufWritePre *.md |MkdirPC|
augroup end
